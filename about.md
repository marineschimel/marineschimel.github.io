I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Computational Neuroscience at Stanford University, advised by Prof. Surya Ganguli and Prof. David Sussillo. My work broadly focuses on trying to understand the mechanisms that underlie various brain computations, using a mix of theory, computational modelling, and data analysis. I am also interested in generative modelling, and development of new methods to dissect datasets of neural recordings.
I grew up in Paris, and moved to Cambridge (UK) for my undergraduate and Masters in Physics. I then stayed there to do a PhD in Computational Neuroscience, advised by Dr Guillaume Hennequin. 
<!-- research fellow in Molecular Modelling and Probabilistic Machine Learning at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cbl-cambridge.org/people/ja666). My interests span generative models applied to molecular modelling, probabilistic modelling, approximate inference and information theory. My PhD research focused on scalable probabilistic reasoning with neural network models. I graduated from the University of Zaragoza in 2018 with an honorary distinction ("premio extraordinario") in Telecommunications Engineering (EE/CS). I was awarded an MPhil in Machine Learning with distinction by the University of Cambridge in 2019. I also do freelance engineering consulting and am a co-founder of [arisetech.es](http://arisetech.es). Bellow are links to some of my recent work, where <sup>\*</sup> denotes equal contribution. -->
