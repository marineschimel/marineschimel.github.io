I am a postdoctoral researcher in Computational Neuroscience at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), advised by [Prof. Surya Ganguli](https://ganguli-gang.stanford.edu/surya.html) and [Prof. David Sussillo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ebBgMSkAAAAJ&hl=fr). My work broadly focuses on trying to understand the mechanisms that underlie various brain computations, using a mix of theory, computational modelling, and data analysis. I am also interested in generative modelling, and development of new methods to dissect datasets of neural recordings.
I grew up in [Paris](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris), and moved to [Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge) for my undergraduate and Masters in Physics. I then stayed there to do a PhD in Computational Neuroscience, advised by [Dr Guillaume Hennequin](https://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/hennequin/).
